##  1 Introduction
As the landscape of education evolves, students encounter new challenges in their learning journey. The increasing complexity of academic subjects, coupled with the need for collaborative learning in today's fast-paced world, has prompted the development of StudyMate. Recognizing the difficulties students face in finding suitable study groups, sharing knowledge effectively, and 
fostering a sense of community, StudyMate aims to bridge these gaps. By providing an interactive platform that facilitates group study, knowledge exchange, and community building, StudyMate 
strives to enhance the overall learning experience for students in universities and beyond.
In this document we will see the different software modelings and how they are modelled. Futhermore we wil look at the purpose, intended audience and scope of this document and project.

## 4 System design
In this chapter we will see the System Design of the StudyMate software modeling and requirement document. In this section, we delve into the architectural blueprint of StudyMate, a revolutionary platform tailored to enhance the educational experience for students and educators alike.

In this chapter, we will elucidate the architectural components, data flow mechanisms, and interaction protocols that underpin StudyMate’s functionality. By exploring the system’s design rationale, you will gain insights into the foundational principles guiding its development and evolution.

Our approach to system design is rooted in modularity, extensibility, and maintainability, ensuring that StudyMate can adapt to evolving educational paradigms and technological advancements. Through comprehensive architectural diagrams, interface specifications, and design patterns, we aim to provide below a comprehensive roadmap for stakeholders involved in the development and utilization of StudyMate.

## 4.1 Domain model
![StudyMate_Domain Model](https://github.com/MetaKt/StudyMate/assets/91473477/f72e3cd6-b504-4b6a-9892-8c3ba020231a)> 

<p align = "center"> Figure 4.1.1 Logical Structural View: Domain Model Diagram </p>

The domain model provides an abstract, high-level overview of the key components within the StudyMate platform, illustrating how users interact with study groups, group activities, general resources, and the ranking system based on their interests. while also outlining the role and responsibilities of the system admin in managing the platform and ensuring security.

**User:**

User of StudyMate, upon creating an account or logging in, gain access to various features. They can join existing study groups or create new ones based on their interests. Within these study groups, users can engage in group activities such as leaving comments, posts, likes, and questions, participating in group chats, uploading materials, and accumulate points for ranking groups. Additionally, users have access to general resources, where they can make use of resources like images, text, files, etc., and contribute by uploading additional resources. 

**Interest:**

User's interests will help the system recommend users study groups to join and resources from the general library to explore, enhancing their overall experience on the platform.
Study Group:
Study groups serve as collaborative spaces for users with shared interests or academic pursuits. Users can join existing groups or create new ones, facilitating collective learning and collaboration.

**Group Activities:**

Within study groups, users can engage in various activities to facilitate learning and interaction. These activities include leaving comments, posts, likes, and questions, participating in group chats, and uploading educational materials to share with other groups or group members. Apart from that there's an additional activity that is the ranking of the study groups. Study groups are ranked based on the points accumulated by their contributions to the general library. 

**Points:**

The system calculates the total points accumulated by all users within a group to determine its ranking. Ranking assigns points to the group of the user according to the amount of likes given by other group members to their posts or the resources they uploaded into the General Library (that depends mostly on the quality and quantity), fostering healthy competition and incentivizing active participation. 

**General Library Resources:**

The General Library is a repository of resources accessible to all users who are in a study group within StudyMate. Users can access and utilize resources available in the library and contribute by uploading additional materials, thereby enriching the collective knowledge base of the platform.

**Admin:**

The system admin holds additional permissions and responsibilities compared to regular users. 
The system admin is tasked with managing various aspects of the platform, including content moderation, group management, and user account administration(managing user profile/accounts by handling tasks such as creating, deleting, and resetting passwords). They have the authority to create, edit, and delete study groups as needed, ensuring the platform remains organized and conducive to learning.
Ensuring the security and integrity of the platform is a key responsibility of the system admin. They are responsible for monitoring content for inappropriate behaviour, taking measures to address reports from users, and implementing security protocols to safeguard the platform and its users from potential threats or breaches.

## 4.2 Use case Diagrams

<p align = "center"> Figure 4.2.1 UseCase Diagram for User </p>

The Use Case Diagram depicts the features an actor is capable of accessing. For our StudyMate Use Case Diagram, it is separated into two distinct diagrams for the ease of comprehension. Figure 4.2.1 above is the Use Case Diagram for Users, representing all the actions a user can perform in StudyMate platform: Sign Up, Login, Join Group, Join Private Group, Create Group, Post, Like Post, Share Post, Browse General Library, Uplaod Resources, Share Resources, Edit Profile, and Edit Group. 

**Sign Up and Login:**

Before accessing into the StudyMate platform, every users must verify themselves. First time user must first signup to the platform, creating their account with unique username, sophisticate password, and interesting bio description. Then, they will have to verify themselves through our authentication methods and select to join at least one interested study group. For users who already have an account, they will need to login with their respective username and password. Only when given with the correct username and password, the user can access to the platform and services.

**Join Group, Join Private Group and Create Group:**

Join Group is an action when users are desiring to entry other study groups apart from which they are already a member of. A list of availiable groups will be provided based on the Recommendation feature, an algorithm which will select groups or resources according to the user's interest. Users will then be able to decide to join any group types: Protected or Private Groups. Protected Groups are groups which their content can be and only visible by non-member users, giving a better image of the group community. Private Groups are groups that only group members can see through their content within the group, allowing more privacy to the group members. Upon clicking join group, users will from the moment become a member of the group they desire to entry, capable of all group members services. Unlike protected, before being a member of a private group, the head of the private group must first accept join private group request from the user. Only the accepted request can give the user permission to entry and become a group member.

**Post:**

StudyMate provides a space for group community to post information in the group. A Post can be text, images, videos, or file documents (**list**). Post is a place aimming to encourage communication within the group, producing an active and lively group study environment. Many benefits group members can gain advantage from posts. For example, making a real-life meet up between group members through post, sharing information related to the group's content, and discussing on a certain topic as one. 

**Like Post and Share Post:**

**Browse General Library:**

**Upload Resources:**
